\title{List of 143 traced P1 neurons from Chiang et al 2011 as neuron objects}
\description{
This R list (which has additional class \code{neuronlist}) contains 143
traced \emph{Drosophila} P1 neurons as \code{neuron} objects. Original data
is due to Chiang et al. [1], who have generously shared their raw data at
\url{http://flycircuit.tw}. Automated tracing of neuron skeletons was carried
out by Lee et al [2]. Image registration and further processing was carried
out by Greg Jefferis, Marta Costa and James Manton [3].
